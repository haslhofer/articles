# Managing time vs. energy
It struck me like lightning when I finally discovered that *managing my time* was an ineffective way of looking at my work day. Discovering this 10 years earlier would have been nice...

## Managing Time

Like many, I aspire to be both effective AND happy in my job. 

But allocating ever smaller slices of time to an ever-increasing number of responsibilities crossed a threshold and became infeasible as I took on a new job a while ago. That role required me to pay attention not only to a singular product from an engineering perspective, but a whole portfolio of products, working with a myriad of people across the world, across multiple disciplines and multiple time zones.

As I got up one morning and looked at 15+ meetings starting at 8am, and ending just before 11pm, all I could feel was exhaustion even before my first meeting had started. 

"How will I get through that?" was the big question in my mind as I sipped my morning coffee and got ready for pressing the "Join Teams Call" button - the first in many to come that day.

It clearly wasn't the time commitment alone that was daunting. In my own start-up I racked up 80-100hr weeks without a sense of mental exhaustion. I wrote code well until after midnight every single day, took a cab home, and started refreshed the next morning. In strategy consulting my colleagues and I had many nights where we worked on presentations until the early hours of the day only to start a full new day after a few hours of sleep, day after day. 

## Managing Energy

What I came to realize was that those two prior jobs were structured in a way to naturally manage my "energy" as opposed to time. Writing code on most days got me in a state of flow that kept adding energy to my day, and I had few other responsibilities that took energy away from me. After most days my energy balance was mostly wildly positive.

Even though the pressure in strategy consulting was tremendously high both based on expectations and short project durations, the feeling of working on a tight crew and the sense of belonging added energy many times throughout the day. We were offsite, started together at a joint breakfast at the hotel, and cracked jokes at 2am with all of us piled up in a cab on our way back to the hotel. 

For me the pandemic exacerbated the sense of "drain" because many of the natural "energy-adding" interactions out of my day (e.g., walking by an engineer's office and discussing a prototype, meeting a program manager at the coffee machine and kicking around product ideas) had disappeared.

## The 20% rule

A podcast I recently listened to asserted backed by research that if you spend less than 20% of your day on activities that energize you, you will quickly be unhappy with your job no matter what. But interestingly, whether you spend 20% or 80% of your day with energizing activities, it doesn't really influence your overall happiness that much. 

It seemed like the combination of the pandemic and the structural difference of my new job had inadvertently pushed me below 20%, leading to this feeling of "getting through" rather than "being happy with what I achieve".

## Changes I made

The good news in all of that is that the "fix" was straightforward. Instead of managing my time, I needed to focus on energy. At a minimum, every single working day needed to have at least 20% of my activities that I knew would generate net positive energy for me personally. Things like writing this essay, talking to innovators at Microsoft, reading about the latest AI research, building a prototype myself, learning a new tool or methodology. 

Actively managing my energy as opposed to time has made a big difference in my life - it gives me peace that even though some of those "energy-positive" activities are neither urgent nor important, they give me energy that spills over into meetings I used to dread, or interactions that made me anxious and drained my mental energy.

Success now is a day where I turn off the computer at night and feel I have energy left to give, rather than a day that was filled with activity that left me with motivational debt.

The difference it made is striking. 

What are your 20%?

# Designing your life

Wow - Twins - Surprise! So some years ago my wife and I decided that it was the right time to design and build a cabin for our family of now 5. 

We love the outdoors. Getting ready for an hour of cross-country skiing with three babies in diapers now required more logistics than traveling overseas for a month when we were just a couple. 

Having a place to stay close to the mountains would allow us to spend more time as a family doing things rather than driving to do things. We had a clear vision of what we were optimizing for and tradeoffs we were willing to make. We looked at more houses than I dare to remember to understand what felt right for us, avoiding mistakes others had made. We were at peace with the energy it would take to realize this vision. We paid handsomely for an architect. At the end it turned out to take 5 years, with pivots along the way that deserve another essay, but we persevered despite many setbacks.

The end result was something we were content with. It fulfilled our original vision because we understood our True North.

During that time it struck me as odd that I spent more time AND mental energy designing this cabin and picking out light fixtures than I had spent coming up with a DURABLE DESIGN FOR MY LIFE, deciding the top priorities I would optimize for, picking the activities to align with them, having clarity of the tradeoffs I'd be willing to make. 

Don't get me wrong - I was never the person to just stumble through life. I always had a deep conviction of the importance of education and how much it would unlock the world for me. I didn't make any rushed choices around who I'd share my life with - until I met the love of my life and then didn't hesitate for a second. I didn't pick jobs at random, and took risks starting a company and moving across continents for a great opportunity to work at Microsoft.

But life is full of choices, small and large. I realized that unless my priorities are CLEAR, CONCISE and WRITTEN down, chances are high I'd start drifting. Just like when building a house, you could invest days in selecting the tile but compromise on the location when pushed to make a choice. Small bad choices will accumulate. And then you end up not liking the end result.

My friend Priya encouraged me to write this essay because, yes, this story does have a happy ending. 

I decided to write down my personal mission statement in three succinct paragraphs. I designed the high-level direction I'd attempt to compare my choices against. It took a few attempts to craft these, see if they rang true to what I deeply felt would be a rewarding life, and not what I thought others wanted me to be. I am predisposed to trying to please people so that was a hard thing for me personally. Since then, for many years now, I sit down (usually around the holidays) and reflect on whether my True North priorities still fit, and how true my actions and choices are compared to them. Encouragingly, my mission statement has withstood the test of time. It goes like this:

## My Mission Statement 

### A strong, centered, curious person 
Stay fit. Create islands for reflection. Enjoy our time as a couple and family. Grow as an explorer and creator. Do my best, all the time. 

### A kind husband, father
Love my wife and children unconditionally. Re-affirm my love through actions regularly. Raise my children with their true long-term welfare in mind. Connect with them and make them feel part of our family. Maintain connection with close family. 

### A creator at work
Create novel, meaningful products and forums as a risk-taking creator. Be a role model at work of championing change, achieving results through creativity, perseverance and collaboration. 

So when I had a career choice to make recently, I started with first principles - is this new job an enabler for me to flourish as a creator? Will it allow me to take risks? Is it an outlet for my creative energy? When faced with time pressure, do I still create islands for reflection (like this essay)? Is my time spent with other people reflective of my desire to reaffirm my love for my children regularly?

Judge me if you will - I clearly don't excel at these dimensions all the time. To the contrary. But having this stable True North in front of me helps me ground my decisions in something larger, more durable - it's my attempt to consciously design my life rather than letting circumstance direct my journey.

I consider writing my own mission statement as some of the highest leveraged hours I spent in my life. I encourage you to try it, too. And I stopped worrying about the tiles.


# Managing your career is your responsibility
One rainy day in Seattle I took inventory of how large my network was within Microsoft after working there for many years. It came up virtually empty. Oops.

My conclusion was easy - my MANAGER clearly didn't do their job to expand my scope! My MANAGER had a far broader reach into the organization, so obviously it was THEIR job to open doors and help me. In hindsight it's almost comical how delusional, disconnected from reality I was even though I had so much faith in my own intellectual prowess. It's not them. Surprise, it's ME!

I knew that growing my impact was predicated on my ability to expand my network within and across the company. Left brain, check.v
But as an introvert it was hard for me to step out of my emotional comfort zone and ACTIVELY connect. Right brain, fail.

The image in my mind ("I'm doing well, progressing fast") was challenged by the reality of hard facts - number of people I'd consider part of my network. I'm not talking about my contact list on LinkedIn or Facebook. You have rich interactions with members of your REAL network. You meet them, discuss things, share things, bond over what excites you, spend time together.

That day I made two big leaps - the first one connecting with a harsh reality. The second one me reaching out to a friendly, well-connected person in Microsoft with a simple request: can you please introduce me to like-minded people in Microsoft who love innovation and 'push the envelope'. Everything changed at that point - I got over my social passivity and started to meet what I personally consider some the brightest minds in tech - many of them on the same campus, in walking distance! Slowly, I got invited to conferences where those people meet. I started getting an outlet for my crazier ideas. 

# Connecting
Our focus on connectivity detracts us from creating human connectedness.

At work I championed a forum I called "My Story". The concept is simple - I offered 25 minutes on a recurring basis for ANYONE on my team (and beyond!) to talk about their life journey and how they - ultimately - ended up at Microsoft.

The only parameters were a fixed 25 minutes of time, no questions from the audience. Think "TED talk about your personal journey". No fancy slides. Just story telling about roads taken, decisions made, succeesses encountered, failures endured, and learnings achieved over a life time.

For most of us, it took a lot of courage to be vulnerable. I can attest to life's journey not always being a straight path from success to success. It's hard to admit in front of audience that you are human. Talking about one's detours takes courage.

The result, though, was stunning - close to 50 team members, from new hires to the most senior people, across the world, demonstrated that while our individual experiences were quite different (growing up in Austria, Romania, India or China has its own unique challenges), there were these unifying themes of trying to better one's life, creating community and belonging even though our jobs required mobility, the trials and delights of having family and children, the curve balls life throws you, and many more. It showed me the things that make us humans as opposed to mere resources aligned for corporate outcomes.

Exacerbated by the pandemic, I discovered an even more urgent need to create ways for us to establish a sense of connectedness rather than mere connectivity, and the one way to get there is to focus on what UNIFIES us as humans.

What's your TRUE network like?

# Explore Exploit
Things you don't like don't help you find things you do like. It's a life lesson I learned as a 16 year old.

My parents had a lively debate which summer job I should take. I was expected to earn money for at least a month. The options were either hard manual labor (working for an asphalt company) or an office job at the local steel mill. Their argument for manual labor was to teach me a life lesson. Show me what I (a pimple faced computer geek) would likely not survive and scare me off to become a "white-collar" worker down the road. The office job on the contrary to gain experience. Reason prevailed and my parents sent me to the steel mill office job. By then I already had more than half a decade of coding behind me, so I naturally flourished in what turned out to be a "computer job". That summer job unleashed a period of entrepreneurial spirit in me as a high-schooler. The asphalt job wouldn't have added any new signal.

In computer science there's what is called the "explore-exploit" dilemma. In order to achieve good results, you have to spend some time finding a good place to be (explore), and then reap the benefits of that place (exploit). The conundrum is that if you explore too little, you'll get stuck in a crappy place. You always explore, you never reap the benefits either.

That makes staying in a place that neither helps you explore nor exploit simply a bad, lazy choice. I remind myself that knowing what you don't like does not lead you to knowing what you like, because there's an infinite number of things you don't like.

Working my hard manual labor job would have offered me no further signal where to venture next. Only more places to avoid. Gaining confidence that a 16 year old could do things in an office most adults couldn't emboldened me to try my luck as a software instructor, high-school graphic designer, computer consultant and database developer years before entering college. That bit of gained confidence and self-understanding unlocked me.

I see life as an orchestration of periods of exploration followed by periods of reaping the rewards of having found a good place, rinse-repeat. So I try to focus on things that either give me POSITIVE new signal (explore) or rewards (exploit). If I get neither, I'm likely wasting my energy, being just lazy.

# Guard rail metrics of your life
On a recent offsite a colleague and I started talking about how we manage the tradeoffs between office work and life at home and some of the life-hacks we were playing around with. We are both dealing with the stresses of cross-geo work so maintaining a predictable schedule is challenging.

"I religiously track how often I get my kids to bed. And take action if it's fewer than 3 times a week" he said.

A lightbulb went off in my head. He has a system of guardrail metrics for his life! What a rich metaphor.

Engineers know that when you run a complex system you'll eventually encounter failure. Catastrophic failiures are easy to spot (when Netflix goes down they'll know, quickly!). But often it's the accumulation of small problems that ultimately lead to bad outcomes: drift! So engineers define guard rails and automate the measurements and alerts around them. You have a safety system that will protect you against a whole class of problems. Not all of them, but if you choose carefully, you'll have a pretty good safety net and you'll know when you're in trouble.

I realized I didn't have explicit guard rails for many of the areas that are important to me. So it's easy to start drifting. For example: Reading is important to me. It keeps my mind growing. But four years ago I discovered that I hadn't read a SINGLE book for more than half a year. Slow drift in my reading habits had ended in what I personally consider failure. A great guard rail metric indicating intellectual decay!

I still believe that a big reason my wife and I not only survived, but thrived having three young children in diapers at the same time was that we had a guard rail metric that kept us grounded: how many dates did we go on during a month. It seemed like a big waste of money to pay for a baby sitter, having to pick them up and drop them off, only for both of us to fall asleep in a parking lot because we were so exhausted (didn't make it to the restaurant!). But I still believe these hard-won hours being a couple instead of parents made all the difference for us. We wouldn't let this guard rail metric of dates / month slide below a threshold. 

# Flawed assumptions
This idea flashed in my mind today: What if I operate with fundamentally flawed assumptions? It felt like a good Saturday evening exercise to enumerate those I seem to have made in the past - not a bad thing to remind myself from time to time to avoid prior traps

## Overstimating the cost of failure

This might also be filed under "acting with fear". I was ripping out a floor all day today. When pulling out a nail with a hammer the nail somehow turned into a seemingly rocket propelled metal object and hit my forehead hard. So clearly the cost of failure in physical tasks is real (I'm glad it didn't hit my eye). But in my job I believe I generally overestimate the cost of taking risks as a knwoledge worker. What truly is the worst possible outcome when taking on a risky project apart from learning a good lesson?

## Assuming best intent instead of rational intent

One of the smartest people I've worked with at Microsoft taught me a valuable lesson a few months ago. I asserted that clearly person X in team Y was acting with best intent. "Don't assume good intent, assume rational intent" my colleage said. It's a pretty fundamentally flawed assumption I've made for decades. Probably worth an article on its own.

## A singular success criterion instead of a balanced scorecard

I do believe that a life well lived is one that achieved success across many dimensions. So it just doesn't make sense to pick only one measure to assess one's progression as life evolves (whether it's money, title, fame, ...). It struck me in career discussions with colleagues over the years that a signluar focus on "will this job help me get promoted" leaves so much to be desired rather than looking at the opportunities a job offers to grow along many other dimensions.

## Assumption of linearity rather than looking for pivots
Life in school and at university was simple in the sense that there was an easy measure of progress - better grades, more degrees. Interestingly, in hindsight I believe this cultivates a degree of risk aversion that works against having a rich set of life experiences - conceptually all I had to do is follow a linear path. But reflecting on my journey the most enduring sources of progress came from pivots in my life - starting a company when friends were progressing in stable jobs; moving across continents; taking a job aligned with my passions rather than optimizing for scope.  
What are your guard rail metrics for life? Do you track them? Do you enforce them? 
I believe it's a powerful way to avoid drift you'll ultimately regret.

# The joy of little things

We usually like to talk about the large but infrequent accomplishments in our jobs - promotions achieved, big projects completed. But I realize that I can find so much joy in the little things around my job every day:

Changing the font on a memo written in Word from Times New Roman to Segoe UI, making headlines bold and colored in an airy hue of blue, changing the distance between the title header and paragraph ever so slightly to give the overall appearance of the document a feeling of lightness and space. And allowing ample distance between the title and first paragraph - so the page feels like someone really cared.

Instead of writing 4 bullet points in an email condensing it down to 3, because 3 items is something people can remember. 2 seems like I didn't care enough to think deeply about it, 4 seems like I didn't care enough to make it more succinct.

Moving my wedding picture just to the right place so I can see it on the margins of my Teams call video screen, reminding myself how lucky I am to have found the love of my life.

Attaching a great microphone to my PC so I can talk softly on video calls which allows me to conserve my energy to think rather than waste it talking loudly.

Printing my todo list on the office printer and crossing items out with a sharp pencil because it creates such a visceral feeling of accomplishment.

Starting the day with three things to accomplish written on the whiteboard in front of me, and leaving the office knowing I at least got these three things done, even though it feels all I did was end up with more unread emails than when I started.

Color grading a video message I send to the team with a high-end video editing tool even though nobody will ever notice.

Seeing ideas I planted many months ago getting picked up and evolved by others.

Working with someone in another company whose best man at his wedding comes from the town in Austria I grew up in - and us finding time as humans and not robots to discover this little random fact.

What little things give you joy?

# Circuit breakers
For a recent business meeting I needed to "dress up" and decided to try on my wedding suit pants which I had purchased 14 years ago. The pants fit just fine. Keeping a healthy weight was always important to me - but I wasn't able to achieve it by sheer will power, but rather by setting up a system I called my "circuit breaker" where I defined an upper boundary at which I'd cut back a little for a few days. For the system to work, I needed to weigh myself consistently. I convinced myself that my weight would probably be lowest in the morning, so I conditioned myself to look at my weight first thing in the morning after I get up. So the system of "accessible scales, consistent weighing, circuit breaker" worked for me over the course of literally decades. 

# One variable at a time
How do you successfully innovate - a hard won lesson of an innovator at heart.

My simplest, most fundamental insight is "only change one variable at a time". This is a hard won lesson. It's based on multiple decades of experience driving innovative projects both in a start-up and large tech setting. It sounds trivial, but it's not. I'm an innovator at heart, and I discovered that it's so easy to get ahead of myself.

Change one variable (a customer use case, a technology, a methodology, an infrastructure) at a time, you might succeed. Change two, you'll generally run out of time and funding.

Successes: When we invented programmable surfaces in Windows [such as those beautiful images on the Windows lock screen] we combined an existing set of technologies for a new use case. It turned out to be a huge, durable success. When we enabled feature flighting in Windows we again used an existing methodology and infrastructure for a new use case and gained broad internal adoption. Some of Microsoft's ContextIQ efforts I was involved in are tackling existing use cases with new technologies - with great progress.

Failures: I faced the hardest challenge when going after a new customer use case with an unproven, emergent technology. I generally ran out of time and organizational support, the hardest won lessons overall. I started these with a strong personal conviction. With anything new you compete against the "known knowns", and even the largest tech companies are inherently resource constrained. The existing backlog is always deeper than the allocated people to address it. Trying to find new product/market fit with an emerging technology - both requiring iteration - will eat more time with pivots than any rational management will dare to wait for. I can point to a few of these - cumulatively years of personal investment that would have had a higher chance of success had I sequenced changing variables rather than trying to do all at the same time. 

Don't discard this as an "of course". The life blood of an innovator is to think boldly and not let the naysayers hold you back. Driving innovation rather than a backlog requires deep conviction and perseverance. But trust me that the lens of "# of variables changed" is worth consideration when you decide to embark on an exhilarating yet exhausting journey towards creating the next new thing.   

# True North - doing the right thing
Doing the right thing is rarely easy, but always worth it.

"Taking the shortcut is cheating" my 9-year old son vehemently postulated while we were having dinner at the Refugio Bruto Carestiato on our 110km long-distance hike through the Italian Dolomites. Our family of five had completed day 6 out of 8 of hut-to-hut hiking on the breathtaking classic Alta Via 1 trail. My wife and I had decided to cut a few miles out of our final full day. 20km of hiking through steep Alpine terrain, including some scrambling to cross Cime de Zita seemed to be just too much. "We came here to do the full trek, and if we take the short-cut we'll never be able to say we actually completed it" my son continued his forceful argument. Our legs were hurting, our backs were aching, I was hesitant to change plans. But he was right that 'True North' is rarely easy, but always worth it. After all of our kids agreed, we cancelled the taxi that night, packed extra water and snacks, and finished the 10hr final leg of the trail tired but proud that we did the right thing - it wasn't easy, but so worth it. A great 'reverse mentoring' lesson from son to father, no doubt.
