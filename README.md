# Managing time vs. energy
It struck me like lightning when I finally discovered that *managing my time* was an ineffective way of looking at my work day. Discovering this 10 years earlier would have been nice...

## Managing Time

Like many, I aspire to be both effective AND happy in my job. 

But allocating ever smaller slices of time to an ever-increasing number of responsibilities crossed a threshold and became infeasible as I took on a new job a while ago. That role required me to pay attention not only to a singular product from an engineering perspective, but a whole portfolio of products, working with a myriad of people across the world, across multiple disciplines and multiple time zones.

As I got up one morning and looked at 15+ meetings starting at 8am, and ending just before 11pm, all I could feel was exhaustion even before my first meeting had started. 

"How will I get through that?" was the big question in my mind as I sipped my morning coffee and got ready for pressing the "Join Teams Call" button - the first in many to come that day.

It clearly wasn't the time commitment alone that was daunting. In my own start-up I racked up 80-100hr weeks without a sense of mental exhaustion. I wrote code well until after midnight every single day, took a cab home, and started refreshed the next morning. In strategy consulting my colleagues and I had many nights where we worked on presentations until the early hours of the day only to start a full new day after a few hours of sleep, day after day. 

## Managing Energy

What I came to realize was that those two prior jobs were structured in a way to naturally manage my "energy" as opposed to time. Writing code on most days got me in a state of flow that kept adding energy to my day, and I had few other responsibilities that took energy away from me. After most days my energy balance was mostly wildly positive.

Even though the pressure in strategy consulting was tremendously high both based on expectations and short project durations, the feeling of working on a tight crew and the sense of belonging added energy many times throughout the day. We were offsite, started together at a joint breakfast at the hotel, and cracked jokes at 2am with all of us piled up in a cab on our way back to the hotel. 

For me the pandemic exacerbated the sense of "drain" because many of the natural "energy-adding" interactions out of my day (e.g., walking by an engineer's office and discussing a prototype, meeting a program manager at the coffee machine and kicking around product ideas) had disappeared.

## The 20% rule

A podcast I recently listened to asserted backed by research that if you spend less than 20% of your day on activities that energize you, you will quickly be unhappy with your job no matter what. But interestingly, whether you spend 20% or 80% of your day with energizing activities, it doesn't really influence your overall happiness that much. 

It seemed like the combination of the pandemic and the structural difference of my new job had inadvertently pushed me below 20%, leading to this feeling of "getting through" rather than "being happy with what I achieve".

## Changes I made

The good news in all of that is that the "fix" was straightforward. Instead of managing my time, I needed to focus on energy. At a minimum, every single working day needed to have at least 20% of my activities that I knew would generate net positive energy for me personally. Things like writing this essay, talking to innovators at Microsoft, reading about the latest AI research, building a prototype myself, learning a new tool or methodology. 

Actively managing my energy as opposed to time has made a big difference in my life - it gives me peace that even though some of those "energy-positive" activities are neither urgent nor important, they give me energy that spills over into meetings I used to dread, or interactions that made me anxious and drained my mental energy.

Success now is a day where I turn off the computer at night and feel I have energy left to give, rather than a day that was filled with activity that left me with motivational debt.

The difference it made is striking. 

What are your 20%?

# Designing your life

Wow - Twins - Surprise! So some years ago my wife and I decided that it was the right time to design and build a cabin for our family of now 5. 

We love the outdoors. Getting ready for an hour of cross-country skiing with three babies in diapers now required more logistics than traveling overseas for a month when we were just a couple. 

Having a place to stay close to the mountains would allow us to spend more time as a family doing things rather than driving to do things. We had a clear vision of what we were optimizing for and tradeoffs we were willing to make. We looked at more houses than I dare to remember to understand what felt right for us, avoiding mistakes others had made. We were at peace with the energy it would take to realize this vision. We paid handsomely for an architect. At the end it turned out to take 5 years, with pivots along the way that deserve another essay, but we persevered despite many setbacks.

The end result was something we were content with. It fulfilled our original vision because we understood our True North.

During that time it struck me as odd that I spent more time AND mental energy designing this cabin and picking out light fixtures than I had spent coming up with a DURABLE DESIGN FOR MY LIFE, deciding the top priorities I would optimize for, picking the activities to align with them, having clarity of the tradeoffs I'd be willing to make. 

Don't get me wrong - I was never the person to just stumble through life. I always had a deep conviction of the importance of education and how much it would unlock the world for me. I didn't make any rushed choices around who I'd share my life with - until I met the love of my life and then didn't hesitate for a second. I didn't pick jobs at random, and took risks starting a company and moving across continents for a great opportunity to work at Microsoft.

But life is full of choices, small and large. I realized that unless my priorities are CLEAR, CONCISE and WRITTEN down, chances are high I'd start drifting. Just like when building a house, you could invest days in selecting the tile but compromise on the location when pushed to make a choice. Small bad choices will accumulate. And then you end up not liking the end result.

My friend Priya encouraged me to write this essay because, yes, this story does have a happy ending. 

I decided to write down my personal mission statement in three succinct paragraphs. I designed the high-level direction I'd attempt to compare my choices against. It took a few attempts to craft these, see if they rang true to what I deeply felt would be a rewarding life, and not what I thought others wanted me to be. I am predisposed to trying to please people so that was a hard thing for me personally. Since then, for many years now, I sit down (usually around the holidays) and reflect on whether my True North priorities still fit, and how true my actions and choices are compared to them. Encouragingly, my mission statement has withstood the test of time. It goes like this:

## My Mission Statement 

### A strong, centered, curious person 
Stay fit. Create islands for reflection. Enjoy our time as a couple and family. Grow as an explorer and creator. Do my best, all the time. 

### A kind husband, father
Love my wife and children unconditionally. Re-affirm my love through actions regularly. Raise my children with their true long-term welfare in mind. Connect with them and make them feel part of our family. Maintain connection with close family. 

### A creator at work
Create novel, meaningful products and forums as a risk-taking creator. Be a role model at work of championing change, achieving results through creativity, perseverance and collaboration. 

So when I had a career choice to make recently, I started with first principles - is this new job an enabler for me to flourish as a creator? Will it allow me to take risks? Is it an outlet for my creative energy? When faced with time pressure, do I still create islands for reflection (like this essay)? Is my time spent with other people reflective of my desire to reaffirm my love for my children regularly?

Judge me if you will - I clearly don't excel at these dimensions all the time. To the contrary. But having this stable True North in front of me helps me ground my decisions in something larger, more durable - it's my attempt to consciously design my life rather than letting circumstance direct my journey.

I consider writing my own mission statement as some of the highest leveraged hours I spent in my life. I encourage you to try it, too. And I stopped worrying about the tiles.


# Managing your career is your responsibility
One rainy day in Seattle I took inventory of how large my network was within Microsoft after working there for many years. It came up virtually empty. Oops.

My conclusion was easy - my MANAGER clearly didn't do their job to expand my scope! My MANAGER had a far broader reach into the organization, so obviously it was THEIR job to open doors and help me. In hindsight it's almost comical how delusional, disconnected from reality I was even though I had so much faith in my own intellectual prowess. It's not them. Surprise, it's ME!

I knew that growing my impact was predicated on my ability to expand my network within and across the company. Left brain, check.v
But as an introvert it was hard for me to step out of my emotional comfort zone and ACTIVELY connect. Right brain, fail.

The image in my mind ("I'm doing well, progressing fast") was challenged by the reality of hard facts - number of people I'd consider part of my network. I'm not talking about my contact list on LinkedIn or Facebook. You have rich interactions with members of your REAL network. You meet them, discuss things, share things, bond over what excites you, spend time together.

That day I made two big leaps - the first one connecting with a harsh reality. The second one me reaching out to a friendly, well-connected person in Microsoft with a simple request: can you please introduce me to like-minded people in Microsoft who love innovation and 'push the envelope'. Everything changed at that point - I got over my social passivity and started to meet what I personally consider some the brightest minds in tech - many of them on the same campus, in walking distance! Slowly, I got invited to conferences where those people meet. I started getting an outlet for my crazier ideas. 


What's your TRUE network like?
