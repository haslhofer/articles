# Managing time vs. energy
It struck me like lightning when I finally discovered that *managing my time* was an ineffective way of looking at my work day. Discovering this 10 years earlier would have been nice...

## Managing Time

Like many, I aspire to be both effective AND happy in my job. 

But allocating ever smaller slices of time to an ever-increasing number of responsibilities crossed a threshold and became infeasible as I took on a new job a while ago. That role required me to pay attention not only to a singular product from an engineering perspective, but a whole portfolio of products, working with a myriad of people across the world, across multiple disciplines and multiple time zones.

As I got up one morning and looked at 15+ meetings starting at 8am, and ending just before 11pm, all I could feel was exhaustion even before my first meeting had started. 

"How will I get through that?" was the big question in my mind as I sipped my morning coffee and got ready for pressing the "Join Teams Call" button - the first in many to come that day.

It clearly wasn't the time commitment alone that was daunting. In my own start-up I racked up 80-100hr weeks without a sense of mental exhaustion. I wrote code well until after midnight every single day, took a cab home, and started refreshed the next morning. In strategy consulting my colleagues and I had many nights where we worked on presentations until the early hours of the day only to start a full new day after a few hours of sleep, day after day. 

## Managing Energy

What I came to realize was that those two prior jobs were structured in a way to naturally manage my "energy" as opposed to time. Writing code on most days got me in a state of flow that kept adding energy to my day, and I had few other responsibilities that took energy away from me. After most days my energy balance was mostly wildly positive.

Even though the pressure in strategy consulting was tremendously high both based on expectations and short project durations, the feeling of working on a tight crew and the sense of belonging added energy many times throughout the day. We were offsite, started together at a joint breakfast at the hotel, and cracked jokes at 2am with all of us piled up in a cab on our way back to the hotel. 

For me the pandemic exacerbated the sense of "drain" because many of the natural "energy-adding" interactions out of my day (e.g., walking by an engineer's office and discussing a prototype, meeting a program manager at the coffee machine and kicking around product ideas) had disappeared.

## The 20% rule

A podcast I recently listened to asserted backed by research that if you spend less than 20% of your day on activities that energize you, you will quickly be unhappy with your job no matter what. But interestingly, whether you spend 20% or 80% of your day with energizing activities, it doesn't really influence your overall happiness that much. 

It seemed like the combination of the pandemic and the structural difference of my new job had inadvertently pushed me below 20%, leading to this feeling of "getting through" rather than "being happy with what I achieve".

## Changes I made

The good news in all of that is that the "fix" was straightforward. Instead of managing my time, I needed to focus on energy. At a minimum, every single working day needed to have at least 20% of my activities that I knew would generate net positive energy for me personally. Things like writing this essay, talking to innovators at Microsoft, reading about the latest AI research, building a prototype myself, learning a new tool or methodology. 

Actively managing my energy as opposed to time has made a big difference in my life - it gives me peace that even though some of those "energy-positive" activities are neither urgent nor important, they give me energy that spills over into meetings I used to dread, or interactions that made me anxious and drained my mental energy.

Success now is a day where I turn off the computer at night and feel I have energy left to give, rather than a day that was filled with activity that left me with motivational debt.

The difference it made is striking. 

What are your 20%?
